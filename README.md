Name of File: sort.c
Description: This is for Project 1 of CIS214-03 with Professor Xinli Wang. 
The purpose of this assignment is to gain familiarity with two different 
sorting techniques - Bubble and Selection. 
Three functions must be defined and implemented: 
	1. Main - to start and time the algorithms by invoking the function 
	2. Selection - The function to run selection sort 
	3. Bubble - The function to run bubble sort

The header file 'sort.h' will be the file that defines each prototype 
function, while the .c file 'sort.c' will be the file that implements 
each function.
